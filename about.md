<p>Hey, Sam here. </p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Toronto in the spring of 2023 with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. 
So far, I've spent 2 years working as an FPGA software engineer, with one of those years being in-between my 3rd and 4th year of school.
Moving forward, I'm looking to explore more within the realm of software dev and what that might bring.
Always open to exciting new opportunities, so don't hesitate to reach out :)</p>

<p>Been experimenting with creative work on the side, as well as picking game dev back up after a hiatus of maybe 4-5 years at this point.
I build PCs too, but doesn't everyone nowadays? It's nice to see the hobby becoming so much more accessible.
Maybe I can call myself a 5e dungeon master in-training.</p>

<p>Oh, did you know that laws are threats made by the dominant socioeconomic-ethnic group in a given nation?
It's just the promise of violence that's enacted and the police are basically an occupying army.<br>
