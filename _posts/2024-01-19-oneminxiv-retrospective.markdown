### Digging up buried memories

Before anything, here's some context and a [link to the channel](https://www.youtube.com/@oneminxiv).

ONE MIN XIV was a side project I worked on for over a month in the summer of 2021.
I think I was tinkering around and learning After Effects that summer; combine that with some boredom and boom, this channel came to be.
Completely forgot that I even made these videos until last week.

In essence, they were short videos of a minute or less covering a specific topic in FFXIV, jazzed up with some motion graphics.
I won't delve into the specific content as that's a whole other can of worms, but I did stop making these due to mainly 2 reasons.
First was burnout, since I was churning these out at a rate of 1.5/week on top of an internship at the time.
The second reason was simply that I didn't know which direction to take the channel in.
Should I focus on very specific niche topics? Or should I focus on new-playing facing ones? Looks like I decided on neither.

### How it was made

Production was mainly done in After Effects, with any graphical assets created in Photoshop.
Looking back, I approached the project surprisingly methodical.
The first order of business was to create all the assets that would be common across all videos.
For example, the intro log motion graphics, character assets, a colour palette, and more.
There was also an AE project template made after the first video to ensure all subsequent videos had the same consistency.

<div class="side-by-side">
    <div style="vertical-align: middle" class="toleft">
        <img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/oneminxiv-assets.png" alt="Alt Text">
        <figcaption class="caption">Some of the assets created</figcaption>
    </div>
    <div style="vertical-align: middle" class="toright">
        <img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/oneminxiv-logo.gif" alt="Alt Text">
        <figcaption class="caption">Logo's motion graphics</figcaption>
    </div>
</div>

The process for creating each video was fairly standard.
1. Decide on a topic and start research.<br>
Depending on the topic, it was usually domain knowledge I've acquired over the years.
On occasion though, some digging into player statistics or game code / infrastructure was needed.
Shout out to [FFlogs](https://www.fflogs.com/) and [Akhmorning](https://www.akhmorning.com/allagan-studies/) for helping with that.
2. Storyboard, write a script, and capture all necessary footage.<br>
Since the goal was to condense useful (interpret that how you may) information into as little time as possible, quite some time was spent asking myself: 
What was the most important information I need to convey? And how do I do it concisely?
3. Production in After Effects.<br>
Since I wanted to add motion graphics easily, I figured doing the whole thing in After Effects would be easier than exporting to Priemere.

In the end, a completed project would look like this:

    </p>

### What's next for ONEMINXIV?

I kinda want to bring it back.

Once I get some more time on my hands, I really do want to make these again.
Playing around with motion graphics while creating content for a game I liked was genuinely a very enjoyable experience.
If that does happen though, I am definitely not holding myself to any form of upload schedule.
It was the "must upload at least once a week" mentality that most likely started the burnout.

Additionally, YouTube Shorts weren't much a thing back when I was making these, so leveraging that format may not be a bad idea.
They had some visibility when they were public for the month, with the best ones doing over 1000 views.
(They were set to private in the aftermath of the burnout for approximately 2 years; they're public again as of writing this)
While those aren't good numbers at all, it was fulfilling enough to me to see people commenting that they learned something new.

I think I've rambled on enough.<br>
Going to leave my favourite video from the bunch here.
