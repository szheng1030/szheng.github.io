### That took too long.

It was due time for me to make some place to consolidate things I've been working on.
I probably spent a bit too much time planning everything out too.
One decision I made early on was to make a website that was animation heavy, as to avoid feeling too manufactured.
Eventually, I stumbled across [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static-site generator built on Ruby.
It supports a blog-like posting system with markdown files and can be easily deployed to GitHub.

On Jekyll's site, they have recommended repositories for templates people have made.
So all it took was finding a template I liked, customizing the content and CSS (still took over a day), and here we are!

### Setting it up

Having never touched much HTML or CSS outside of scraping websites, this was an experience.
That being said, it was more intuitive than I expected.

From how I understand it, Jekyll websites are built with the Liquid template language (created and used by Shopify, TIL).
Liquid allows the definition of variables, filters, objects, etc., making it very similar to other programming languages.
It also defines layouts, which are guidelines or backbones of how pages are created.
So if you need to create multiple pages that have similar content, you'd use one layout and tweak the finer stuff individually.
Which, in our case, for creating a blog-like system, is perfect!

It felt like working with an OOP language, so that was cool. As much as we want to stretch that definition :)

### Some fun along the way

Deploying to GitHub was fairly simple; I did mess up the repository name though.
I mistyped the repo name as *szheng.github.io* instead of *szheng1030.github.io*.
As a result, while the domain name became the monstrosity that is *szheng1030.github.io/szheng.github.io*, subpages like about were still linking to *szheng1030.github.io/about*, effectively breaking them.
Eventually found my problem but it sure was an amusing half-hour trip.
Didn't help that the site is previewed on localhost when testing locally. Its "domain" and subpages were of *localhost:4000/about/*, so no wonder it never came up in testing.

I originally had Brennan's quote about laws being threats on the front page like this:

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/lawsarethreats.jpg" alt="Old home page featuring BLeeM's infamous quote of Bud Cubby the anarcho-socialist halfling"/>
  <figcaption>Old home page featuring BLeeM's infamous quote of Bud Cubby the anarcho-socialist halfling</figcaption>
</p>

Friend said that it felt a little bit too threatening as the first thing someone sees, and yeah, I kinda have to agree.
Hesitantly moved it to the About section where it now resides.
For legal reasons, this is 100% just a bit and something fun to quote.

### What now?

I'm not too sure where I want to take this site at the moment.
For the foreseeable future, blog posts will most likely be updates on stuff I'm working on, anything I find amusing, rabbit holes, etc.
Projects for now will just host retrospectives of recent past projects. Of course, adding new finished projects as time goes on.
Hopefully, it won't get too messy.

If you've made it this far, thanks. <br>
Not sure how you've stumbled onto this site but I appreciate the time regardless.

I've been listening to [Dwellings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyesX3ZRe90) again recently.
Thought they were pretty well known for the longest time, but guess I just never bothered checking their numbers.

Their music is awesome.
